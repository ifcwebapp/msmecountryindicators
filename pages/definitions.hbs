    <p>The MSME Country Indicators Database 2014 records the number of formally registered micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across 155 economies. It attempts to provide an objective and unique overview of the MSME sector which can be complemented with other data sources. The MSME-CI fills a knowledge gap regarding structural indicators of the enterprise sector by firms’ size at the country level for all regions of the world. The 2014 update includes the latest country MSME definitions, number of enterprises, employment figures, sectorial distribution, and historical data. In addition, the 2014 update kick-starts the collection of information regarding MSME contribution to the economies and includes information on multiple MSME definitions and data sources within a country. Furthermore, the 2014 update aims to differentiate the statistics provided not only at the micro, small, medium, and large enterprise level but also in aggregate results such as total SMEs as well as total MSMEs.</p>

        Through the study of definitions and data associated, the analysis note provides an overview of the MSME-CI database. After summarizing the key takeaways, the MSME definitions are analyzed in respect to their sources and main variables. The data analysis section provides a statistical description and an exploration of the MSME sector relationship with access to finance, investment climate, institutional frameworks, inequality and poverty. The annexes detail methodological information and expand descriptive statistics for selected topics.
